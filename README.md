Hello, dear internet traveller.

This is a collection of modding tools related to Relic Entertainment's Company of Heroes and Dawn of War 2. These things are in no way endorsed or related to Relic, Sega, or whoever owns those games now.

Unfortunately I have very little recollection of any of the details in these tools. I wrote them when I was just a teenager, and it's probably not what you should take as an example of good programming, or anything else really. All the bugs that you find in there are yours to fix. I have no interest or time to continue developing these tools, but you are invited to take this on yourself.

Licensing: There are a few parts in this repository that probably fall under someone else's license. They should mostly be called out where they are used (zlib, some image stuff). If they are not, I'm sorry: it's been a long time and I don't recall.

For all of the code that I wrote: Please assume an MIT License. No warranties.
